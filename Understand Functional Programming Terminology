Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. 
Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.

const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27); //
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13); //


console.log(
  tea4GreenTeamFCC,
  tea4BlackTeamFCC
);
